# `minstructor`

I'm a huge fan of https://github.com/jxnl/instructor, so the purpose of this library is to walk you through how to build your own.
I think that it's worthwhile to understand the core concepts.

## Tutorial

Check /tutorial/Tutorial.md.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/jbarrow/minstructor.git
pip install -Ue .
```
